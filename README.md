# Implementation of data structures in Golang

This is an implementation of the data structures that I like in Golang. The idea is to implement very basic versions of the data-structures first. Over time I will work on optimizing and enhancing them.

## List of data structures implemeted

- Linked List
    - What is a linked list? - [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
    - [Single Linked List](linkedlists/singlelist.go) for storing int types
    - [Generic linked list](linkedlists/genericsinglelist.go) for storing any type of data
- [Ring Buffer](ringbuffer/ringbuffer.go)
